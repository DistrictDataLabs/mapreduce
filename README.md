## About

Google's MapReduce framework powered the first version of Hadoop by providing a programming abstraction for cluster computing in parallel. However, this abstraction can be used in a multiprocessing context on a single computer as well. This repository is a proof of concept library for MapReduce on a multiprocess machine.
